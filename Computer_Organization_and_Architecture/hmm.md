## BCD
Binary Coded Decimals

## Complements
- Used in digital computers _ simplifying subtraction operation and for logical manipulation.

__2 Types__ - 

### r's complement
- If N is a no. to base r with integer part of n digit, the r's complement of N is defined as :
\
$r^{n} - N$
\
, where r = base of no.
\
n= no. of integer digits
\
N = given (+)ve no.

### (r - 1)'s complement
- If N is a no. to base r with integer part of n digit and m fraction digits, the (r-1)'s complement of N is defined as :
\
$(r^{n} - 1) - N$   OR   $(r^{n} - r^{-m}) - N$
\
, where r = base of no.
\
n= no. of integer digits
\
N = given (+)ve no.
\
m = fraction digits

- Basically whatevers closest to $r^{n}$.


### Some stuff here
- There are two complement forms used in digital systems to represent signed numbers. These are 1's complement and 2's complement. 
- These two forms are used to represent negative numbers. 
- Most computer performs subtraction by 2's complement method. 
- The advantage of performing subtraction by complement method is reduction in hardware instead of having separate digital circuits for addition and subtraction. 
- Only adding circuits are needed, i.e., subtraction is also performed by adders only.

### 1's complement
- To calculate 1's complement of binary no., simply change all 1's to 0 and all 0's to 1.
