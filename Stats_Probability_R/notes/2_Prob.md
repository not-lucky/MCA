## Basic Probability Theory: Rules and Formulas

### Probability

- measure of the possibility _ an event will occur in random experiment
- value b/w 0 and 1
- 0: no chance of happening
- 1: definitely will happen
- <0 or >1 means miscalculation

### Trail

- any particular performance of a random experiment
- basically means random experiment
- each trail results in >=1 outcomes
- ex: tossing coin, tossing 4 coins, rolling die, etc.

### Random Experiment

- possibility of coming outcomes but not sure what is to come

### Event/Outcome

- something that results
- result caused by previous action
- these results are called events
- denoted by capital english letter (A,B,C...)

### Sample Space

- set of all possible outcomes of random exp.
- denoted by S
- events: subset of sample space
- written withing curly braces

Example: Rolling die
S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }
Event A = {1, 3, 5}
Event B = {2, 4, 6}

## Basic Probability Theory: Rules and Formulas Part 2

### Probability Rules

- P(A) : pobability of A, A is event
- P(A|b) : probability of A given B occurs
- P(not A) : prob of not A
- or is Union U
- and is intersection ê“µ
- mutually exclusive events: events that CANT occur at same time 

### Addition Rule

- If A and B NOT mutu. excl.
  - $P(A\ or\ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\ and\ B)$
- If A and B NOT mutu. excl.
